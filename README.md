# Module_5_Challenge -Pymaceuticals

# Challenge
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The purpose of this activity is to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study, including a high-level summary of the study results.

# The following visuals were generated: 

 > Summary Stats Table
 
 > Statistical Summary Table for Tumor Volume

 > Bar plots showing the Number of Observed Timepoints per Drug Regimen - using Pandas & Pyplot
 
 > Pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using Pandas - using Pandas & PyPlot
 
 > Box plot showing the distribution of the tumor volume for each Drug Regimen
 
 > Line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin
 
 > Scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen

In addition, we also calculated the correlation and regression for mouse weight and average observed Tumor Volume for Capomulin and plotted the findings in a scatter plot chart with a linear regression line and equation.
